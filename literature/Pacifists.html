              I've seen him burning <br>
              under a great large birch tree.<br>
              The planks were lit,<br>
              but<br>
              the leaves were still wet with the mist of tomorrow.<br>
              The Aurora in the sky danced<br>
              with the grace of Thunder.<br>
              Corrosive looks<br>
              started glaring at him,<br>
              though he was still flamboyant.<br>
              He lit the torches<br>
              with the sacred fire<br>
              on his shoulders.<br>
              The torch ignites with teal colored flames.<br>
              And the flying leaves<br>
              started orbiting around them<br>
              enchanted with the breath of god.<br><br>

              OH!<br>
              How I wanted him to keep going.<br>
              Eclipse after eclipse<br>
              he moves<br>
              as his body ran stale.<br>
              The warmth<br>
              that he generated could give hope to a whole new generation.<br>
              But his emerald eyes,<br>
              the last grain of starch<br>
              washed out as his emotions gave out.<br>
              And he flinched.....<br>
