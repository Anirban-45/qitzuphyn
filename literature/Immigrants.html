              Welcome, welcome to the vast majority of your troubles that you are going to go through until you struggle and eventually perish. I'm here to spontaneously guide you throughout this process as you think through the loopholes of your demise.<br><br>

              You are in a transport, a basic Item/tool for you to go from point A to point B. where you are going now in currently unknown. And as you've just gotten into this mess you don't remember much of your origin. Firstly, you are an entity over here just like you are in the optimal and your very own reality, even your physical structures are the same. You seem to be leaving the visual proximity range of a previously existing sphere[planet] which is now clouded by a humongous explosion. And might I emphasize that it (the explosion) is very much visible. From your transports concave glass openings, you marvel at the explosion for quite an adequate amount of time. Maybe it’s because this is the first time you're watching a death of a star and its family. And even though it’s a hell for you where it's happening you find it mesmerizing to look at.<br><br>

              Anyway, coming back to your conscious self you don't remember much about how you fell into this situation. You find a console that is hardly giving you any evidence of your current condition. You see you are named as survivor#168. And people who are floating with you on the space on their own transports are communicating by addressing each other as "survivor#" and then somewhat number. As you totally don't remember your name and this one is pretty distinctive itself you don't find any relevance of forcing yourself to retain that name back. You also don't remember your lifespan, relatives, job, purpose or even your adolescence tinglings. You now dive into the terminal for finding information. It says, "Attention survivor!! as you all know our planet is no more. It's been 65 days since it's star ran out of fuel and got blown up. Now we are traveling through the space in individual spacecraft’s coordinated together. Hopefully, we'll find another habitable planet where we can settle. Till then we can communicate with each other through the terminal. At least there are a few more days until we all go to hyper-sleep. Thank you". Considering these circumstances, you remembering your past is pretty unnecessary. You now interpret the situation by yourself. So this is an act of desperation, a deep desire to live on. We could just have stayed with the other people that had no other way and met their doom. But we all attempted to elongate our destiny for a few days. Was the journey, from a man on the planet to a man on space hard? Was it unconventional in others eyes? Who knows?<br><br>

              Ahem.... ahem........... for the sake of plot and drama let’s now recreate you as a third person and talk about his relentless enduring horizons.<br>

              Now survivor#168 sits barely for 20 minutes according to the pendulum he received in his shuttle and thinks nothing. After that, questions start coming into his mind, questions so immobile that makes existence itself pathetic. Why did it happen? Where do we think our routes would take us to? Or is it just going to abandon us? How did he become so unfathomably lucky?<br><br>

              It's actually the truth. Survivor#168 and the few other survivors who are passing vigorously through this dark unavoidable empty space are really very lucky to be able to just breathe. And how unfair they make it look like for the ones who couldn't make it. For a few people, they seem to be unimaginably privileged. There were so many people who didn't even know that there is even a way out. Many of the spacecraft got destroyed in the radical flames and shock waves from the very faraway blast. some of them even got hit by asteroids or their spacecraft malfunctioned. They are not continuing their journey now. But the question still stands how they are alive right now is not what they are struggling for. As they pass through stars, solar systems, meteors, clusters, dust clouds and galaxies they're all looking for a place to land upon and call it "Home".<br><br>

              Habitable zones in the universe Is a massively rare sight to see. Finding a star that's circling there wouldn't even have 0.5% of possibility. And finding that star right next to their trajectory is next to impossible. So ultimately, having all these possibilities altogether the odds of them finding a reasonably okay place is between 1 to 325 Quintillion. God, even I find that number impossible to comprehend. [sigh......]<br><br>

              The shuttles have some decent tech inside. Having dark matter circulating through the engine their fuel source is technically endless, that is when they are drifting through a dark matter field. Then again there is no end to dark matter in this universe. But the space craft itself will inevitably collapse due to erosion or malfunction. As neither it can withstand the chaos which is the universe, nor the entropy that inhabits in everything of that chaos. These questions of him they keep bubbling up inside of him and finally it came to, "Where did it go wrong?". Now as he's in a hypothetical universe something far more sinister engulfs his mind.<br><br>

              Is the universe even that randomized? Can we possibly be very close to the edges of the universe and still travelling outwards? Is this universe expanding or shrinking? Does space and time create continuum over here? Does gravity even let us circle around an object in a parabolic motion here? He thought of asking through the terminal but his hands gave out. He finds himself courage less. Unaware of all these possibilities he is now here, existing, breathing and thinking of doing the same thing tomorrow somewhere else in a lot less perplexing manner. He contradicts himself, "That's not how a person reacts". In the end he let the stoic in him rise up, became calm and subtly gulped down his ambiguity. What a bizarre state of uncertainty yet so pursuable. He thought of living the last few days exerting all the pressures that he previously had. Suddenly, some weird noise came out of a spacecraft not so far from his own. It started regulating wild sound and lights as it started spinning on its own. Then it crashed to its nearby one and got out of track. They were done for, there isn't possibly a way for the other survivors to rescue survivor#231 and #89. Their crafts then swayed away from the course of the whole fleet as they circle each other around like helix strands. Communications were lost in an instance; It looked like they foxtrot waltzed through the dark deeming never ending stage and perished towards the vicinity of oblivion. [Commotion ended for that time...........]<br><br>

              16 more days past. After watching a sudden malfunction, they were left in awe. Even with all the navigations, approximately 0.008au per hour speed and 3 successful hyper jumps they couldn't even find a spot or hint where to look for. So finally they decided to go for a hibernation [and by hibernation I mean their optimism meter ran dry]. #168 opened up the sleep-pod and went inside comfortably, accepting the anguish they've gone through. The lid of the pod closed very slowly as he saw freezing agents activates emitting shadowy mists. The lid closed up. The terminal is cluttered with texts and voice mails of the people telling to relax and wishing goodbyes to each other. #168 blinked faster twice or thrice and then glanced through the glass door of the pod through his transports window maybe for the very last time. Close by a circling quasar with reddish tint bade farewell with stellar dusts and object reflecting their lights to the transport. He fazes for a while then the anesthetic gasses start coming out of the vents. A deep deep slumber awaits them.<br><br>

              An unnecessarily huge length of time passes. The interface wakes you up. In this case survivor#168 opened his eyes. The console shows imagery that it took and found a possible match of a habitable surface. OH BOY!! The few survivors who still managed to stay along the stream went close enough to thoroughly check the ground and atmosphere level of the certain stellar body. It was a goddamn miracle. Apparently Its a planet. Where there is just the right amount of mass to form gravity to hold them and let them move. The right amount of distance from the nearest star to maintain temperature and the right amount of atmospheric pressure to form molecules that supports life. The right amount of spin and magnetic field to protect from radiation and the right amount of seasonal variation. The right amount of satellite distance to maintain the tide flow, the right amount of harmonic particle cycle for nutrients to grow. And animate life. They named this planet: 3497H<br><br>

              #168 can’t believe his own nerves. They see beings on the planet surface fundamentally just like them. Short spanned, developed and communicable. Against all odds they've found the most accurate place they could ask for. It’s as if someone has purposefully made this planet [*...wink...] approachable to them. Odds itself was an odd in this case and yet they reached it and will be able to exist in their own bodies. Just before they pierce through the atmosphere of the planet the survivors scanned the planet for one last time. Soon they find out of an untold horror that haunts this planet from the beginning of time.<br><br>

              They find Decay, decay of the planet itself as it melts away at one part and wash away at the other. Burn off thousands of land mass, cut off thousands of sky holes. Outsiders can see them but they can't see the outsiders from their cloak of pollution. The planet shows disease, calamities, and ginormous possible threats. Inhabitants self-harm and even harm others that don't look like them. They've created their own terms like culture, religion, economy, status, society, law and rotated them against each other. These inhabitants show malice, violence, fear, hatred, grief, agony, chaos and miseries. This planet is as terrifying and horrible as it is perfect and beautiful.<br><br>

              Now look, the reason I told you all these facts, asked you all these amateur questions and stories is not to brag about earths health nor am I trying to be an ecological Karen or something. But think about this once in a while. What the fuck have you given to this tiny little paradise where resources are generated for you automatically. Have people ever tried to stay neutral for a few days. Our abysmal level of empathy towards each other and yet we still somehow gain enough confidence to talk about preserving this race. Our subjugation and rebellion has created anarchy such large that its terrorizing the sustainability of the ambience, where you may have a chance to develop and thrive. Is it so necessary to display your dominance of biological signature? Let me give you a choice or maybe demand a tiny resolution; Find a way out for the survivors. While this is their only hope of living there's even a chance of being end up at a research facility as a research specimen. Or maybe they were able to live here, can they really blend in? They could even be stoned to death just for emerging from a distant place. But with all odds each and every ship has the potential to bring compassion towards life and the thing that support life. In this tiny distant isolated sphere which is surfaced by tiny moving carbon units we have only ourselves to preserve. So, will you radiate that little bit of compassion? You make what you believe and you keep believing those what you live for, thank you for your time.<br><br>
